# AI@Columbia

AI@Columbia is now officially recognized as part of the Intergoverning Board (IGB) club! Our membership spans 600 members across all departments, reflecting the broad interest and collaboration in AI-related research and projects at Columbia University.

## Steering Committee

Our steering committee is comprised of current students, guided by the invaluable insights and experience of our alumni. The committee's role is to oversee the club's activities, strategic direction, and ensure that we stay aligned with our mission and goals.

## Our Origins

AI@Columbia was founded by a group of postdocs and PhD students two years ago, prior to receiving approval from the IGB. Their vision and dedication have laid the foundation for what the club has become today.

The club has a strong alumni base, will will be helping to guide the club's strategy, particularly in shaping 2024-2025 year's programming and in the selection process for the next leadership, which will take place one year from now. Their guidance will be crucial as we continue to grow and evolve.

## Get Involved

We encourage members from all departments to participate in our events, workshops, and discussions. Whether you're a seasoned AI researcher or just beginning your journey, AI@Columbia offers a platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation.

We look forward to a bright future and to the many contributions our members will make to the field of AI.
